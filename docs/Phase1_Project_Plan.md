# Kingtavo Project Plan Phases

_This suite of six phase-based plans provides LLM-ready, task-and-subtask breakdowns for implementing the unified Kingtavo platform: a multi-tenant ERP + employee-store solution merging Printavo's production management with KingClothing's e-commerce storefront._

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Sync Framework (10 weeks)

**Objectives:** Establish core infrastructure, authentication, and data synchronization.

1. **Project Setup & Repository** (1 week)
   - Create GitHub repository with branch protection.
   - **Initialize Project:** Use the latest `create-next-app` with recommended flags:
     ```bash
     npx create-next-app@latest kingtavo-app --ts --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"
     ```
     *(Ensure you have Node.js 23.11.0+ installed)*
   - Set up Tailwind CSS 4.1.4+, ESLint, Prettier, Husky hooks.
   - Configure shadcn/ui & Flowbite 3.1.2+ with Flowbite-React 0.11.7+ components (Refer to `Phase2_Flowbite_Setup_Guide.md`).
   - Establish project structure (feature-based, e.g., `src/features/quotes`).

2. **Authentication & Multi-Tenancy** (2 weeks)
   - Set up Supabase project.
   - Define core `company`, `users`, `roles` tables (See `Phase1_Database.md`).
   - Configure Supabase Auth (Email/Password initially).
   - Implement Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for multi-tenancy.
   - Create auth flow using Next.js Middleware and Supabase SSR helpers.
   - Build user/org onboarding and profile UI using Flowbite components.
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) checks (in middleware and/or tRPC procedures).

3. **Database Schema & Migrations** (3 weeks)
   - Design core entity schema (Quotes, Orders, Products, Customers, etc. - See `Phase1_Database.md`).
   - Implement Supabase migrations using the Supabase CLI.
   - Set up RLS policies for all relevant tables.
   - Seed initial data (lookup tables, test tenant) using `supabase/seed.sql`.
   - Generate TypeScript types from DB schema (`supabase gen types ...`).

4. **Data Synchronization Service (ETL)** (4 weeks)
   - Scaffold a Node.js 23.11.0+ microservice (or set up Supabase Edge Functions) for ETL.
   - Create Printavo connector (GraphQL API interaction).
   - Build transformation logic to map Printavo data to Kingtavo schema.
   - Implement initial load/sync procedures (e.g., for `company` data).
   - Implement webhook endpoint for real-time events (See `Phase3_Integration_ETL.md`).
   - Design basic monitoring dashboard for sync status (UI can use Flowbite tables/badges, data fetched via tRPC potentially powered by @tanstack/react-query 5.74.4+).

**Deliverables:** Supabase migrations & seeds; auth flow with protected routes; functional ETL for static data; initial project structure setup.
