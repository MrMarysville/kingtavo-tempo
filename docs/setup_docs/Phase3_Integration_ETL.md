# ETL & Webhook Integration

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the design for Kingtavo's data synchronization pipeline and real-time webhook system. The ETL pipeline handles bulk data integration with external systems (primarily Printavo), while the webhook system enables real-time data updates between systems.

Both systems are critical infrastructure components enabling accurate, timely data flow between Kingtavo, customers' Printavo accounts, and other integrated platforms.

## ETL Pipeline Design

### Overview

The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline serves as the backbone for synchronizing data between Printavo and the Kingtavo platform. It ensures:

- Regular, scheduled data extraction from external systems
- Proper transformation and normalization of data
- Reliable loading into the Kingtavo database
- Historical tracking and reconciliation capabilities

### Components

1. **Connector Services**
   - **Printavo Connector**: Interfaces with Printavo's API 
   - **Strapi Connector**: Handles Content Management integration
   - **Custom Connectors**: Extensible design allows for additional integrations

2. **Transformer**
   - Converts extracted data to match Kingtavo schema
   - Applies business logic and validation rules
   - Resolves entity relationships
   - Handles data normalization and consolidation

3. **Loader**
   - Efficiently inserts/updates records in PostgreSQL
   - Manages transaction boundaries
   - Implements conflict resolution strategies
   - Maintains data integrity constraints

4. **Orchestrator**
   - Schedules and coordinates ETL jobs
   - Monitors job status and performance
   - Implements retry policies
   - Provides logging and notification mechanisms

### Sequence Flow

1. Extraction triggered (scheduled or on-demand)
2. Source credentials validated
3. Data retrieved in batches to avoid API rate limits
4. Raw data stored in staging tables
5. Transformation applied based on entity type
6. Data validated against business rules
7. Load operations executed with appropriate transaction boundaries
8. Success/failure status recorded with metrics
9. Notifications sent for critical events

### Error Handling

- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Partial Success**: Ability to continue processing valid records when some fail
- **Validation Failures**: Detailed error reports for records failing validation
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Storage for records that cannot be processed
- **Manual Resolution**: Admin interface for resolving data conflicts

## Webhook System

### Overview

The webhook system provides real-time data propagation between systems, enabling immediate updates when data changes occur in either Printavo or Kingtavo.

### Registration API

The webhook registration API allows:

1. External systems to register endpoints for receiving Kingtavo events
2. Kingtavo to register for events from external systems
3. Configuration of event filtering rules
4. Authentication and authorization of webhook endpoints

API Endpoint: `/api/v1/webhooks/register`

### Storage Schema

Webhooks are stored in the database with the following key attributes:

```
{
  id: UUID,
  source_system: string,
  target_url: string,
  event_types: string[],
  headers: JSON,
  secret_key: string (encrypted),
  status: enum(active, suspended, error),
  created_at: timestamp,
  updated_at: timestamp,
  last_triggered: timestamp,
  failure_count: integer
}
```

### Dispatcher Flow

1. Event triggered in source system
2. Relevant webhooks identified based on event type
3. Payload formatted according to target requirements
4. Security signature generated
5. HTTP request dispatched with retry capability
6. Response validated and logged
7. Metrics updated for monitoring

### Security & Validation

- **HMAC Authentication**: All webhook payloads include a signature header
- **TLS Required**: All webhook endpoints must support HTTPS
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against excessive webhook triggering
- **Payload Validation**: Schema validation before dispatch
- **IP Restrictions**: Optional IP allowlisting for added security

## Monitoring & Metrics

The following metrics are tracked for both ETL and webhook systems:

- Total records processed
- Success/failure rates
- Processing time
- Error distribution by type
- Data volume by entity
- API call statistics
- Queue depth and latency

These metrics are exposed via Prometheus-compatible endpoints and visualized in operational dashboards.
