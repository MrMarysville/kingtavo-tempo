# Kingtavo Implementation Guide

This implementation guide provides a structured approach to building the Kingtavo platform - a multi-tenant ERP system for screen printing and embroidery businesses. The guide is organized into phases, with each phase building upon the previous one.

## Implementation Phases

1. **Foundation** - Core infrastructure, database schema, authentication, and multi-tenancy
2. **Core Modules** - Product catalog, order management, and decoration techniques
3. **Integrations** - Payment processing, shipping, accounting, and external services
4. **Production Management** - Task engine, kanban board, and workflow management
5. **AI & UX Enhancements** - GPT integration, vision AI, and mobile optimization
6. **Polish & Scale** - Analytics, compliance, performance, and documentation

## How to Use This Guide

Each phase is documented in its own file with detailed implementation steps. Follow these steps in order:

1. Read the overview document for the phase you're implementing
2. Review the database schema and data models
3. Implement the backend components (database migrations, API endpoints)
4. Implement the frontend components (UI, forms, validation)
5. Test the implementation
6. Move to the next phase

## Industry-Specific Context

Kingtavo is designed specifically for screen printing and embroidery businesses, with features tailored to the unique needs of this industry:

- **Decoration Techniques** - Support for screen printing, embroidery, DTG, and vinyl/heat transfer
- **Equipment Profiles** - Tracking of industry-specific equipment like presses, embroidery machines, and heat presses
- **Production Workflows** - Specialized workflows for screen room, embroidery, and other decoration processes
- **Pricing Models** - Complex pricing based on decoration technique, quantity, placement, and special requirements
- **Artwork Management** - Handling of industry-specific file formats and production requirements

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js with React and TypeScript
- **UI Components:** Shadcn/UI with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions)
- **State Management:** React Server Components + TanStack Query
- **API Layer:** tRPC for type-safe API endpoints
- **Deployment:** Vercel (Frontend), Supabase Cloud (Backend)

## Getting Started

Begin with Phase 1: Foundation to set up the core infrastructure and database schema. Each subsequent phase builds upon the previous one, adding more functionality to the platform.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/kingtavo.git

# Install dependencies
cd kingtavo
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Supabase credentials

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Implementation Status

The implementation status is tracked using the following indicators:

- ‚úÖ Completed
- üü° Started but not completed
- ‚ùå Not started

Refer to each phase document for detailed status of individual tasks.
